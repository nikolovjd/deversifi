# Trade App
## Usage
1. ``npm install`` and ``npm start`` in both /frontend and /backend

## Notes
1. Both projects have their own README.md with additional information
2. frontend runs in port ``3000`` and backend runs in port ``3005`` and can only be changed in code
3. Due to the time limit, test coverage is low. An example of a non-generated test would be on ``backend/src/auth/strategies``
